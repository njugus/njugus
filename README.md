Here's a fun fact about programming: the term "bug" to describe a flaw in a computer program originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found an actual moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. She removed the moth and taped it into the computer's logbook with the annotation,
"First actual case of bug being found." Since then, "debugging" has been a common term for fixing issues in software.
